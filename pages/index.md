I am a postgraduate at Tianjin University, major in Information and Communication Engineering.

My research interest lies in 3D computer vision, including 3D scene understanding, 3D reconstruction, and 3D generated content, and I am currently working on point cloud completion. In my spare time, I like to develop front-end web pages. In this way, not only can I effectively display my own research results, but I also devote myself into learning skills of wonderful web visual design. Dreaming up ideas and making them come true is where my passion lies.

Outside of programming, I enjoy listening to music. If you happen to be obsessed with classic music (currently Bruckner Symphony No. 8), maybe we can hang out and exchange records or code together.
