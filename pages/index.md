I am a postgraduate at Tianjin University, major in Information and Communication Engineering.

My research focuses on 3D vision and i am currently working on point cloud analytics. In my spare time, i like to develop front-end web pages. In this way, i can not only effectively display my own research results, but also devote myself into learning skills of wonderful web visual design. Dreaming up ideas and making them come true is where my passion lies.

Outside of programming, I enjoy listening to music. If you happen to be in the same city I live (currently in Tianjin), maybe we can hang out and go to the theater or code together.
